This is a small python script meant to isolate a tool change inside a gcode file in order to easily test the filament ramming and cooling settings
This means that in order to test those slice settings you can now slice the models provided (or any model for that matter, having a small gcode file just helps with the processing time) using two different extruders and save the gcode file as test.gcode (replacing the file that is currently in this folder) you can then run the python script which will overwrite the second file TipTest.gcode. You can then load that file(TipTest.gcode) on your sd card and run it on your printer. When running it the printer should heat up to the chosen temperature and perform a small extrusion then perform the ramming and cooling sequence, followed by a quick retraction to keep the filament far from the melt-zone and keep the tip as is.
