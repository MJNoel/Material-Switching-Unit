# MMU2-on-any-printer
I'll progressivly add files on the github as the projects goes on, these are not final. Checkout my youtube channel for more info. This github is currently meant for people that want to take a look at the files or that want to help with the project. 


The list below is only ideas and any help is appreciated so if you have a cool idea or feature you would like to see added go for it.
What would be helpful:

Physical:
* cleaner models (I didn't really take care of aesthetics so if you think you can improve the design go for it)
* clean way to add a filament sensor

Software:
* any potential bug
* quality of life improvement: physical buttons, info on LCD + interface, implementing a filament sensor ( error detection and "SpoolJoin" )
