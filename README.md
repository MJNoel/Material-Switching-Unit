# MMU2-on-any-printer
I'll progressively add files on the repository as the projects goes on, these are not final. Checkout my youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF2tb5Hu6G_z-tB3_e_9U4A) for more info. This github is currently meant for people that want to take a look at the files or that want to contribute to the project. For now the minimum  board requirements are at least 5 independent motor control(X,Y,Z,Extruder,Idler) make sure to take into account dual Z steppers(can be solved easiely by using a splitter), but I highly recommend 6 independent motor controls because depending the result of the testing we may go to a direct drive route which would require an extra motor (the first tests indicate that we will not necessarly need a direct drive extruder setup and with that only 5 stepper motor controls but I still highly recommend to get a board with at least one more control since the direct drive setup will most likely be way more reliable and capable, this also gives you an upgrade path with your printer). If you are planning on contributing I recommend using the SKR pro (V1.1 is the one I am using but V1.2 will also work since they are basically the same) and if not you should definitely wait because things like the SKR mini E3, 1.3, 1.4 and a lot of cheaper boards could work which would mean a much lower price and also a cleaner implementation (if you have and ender 3 or similar). We are getting close to a functional prototype so you will know which board to go for soon enough
